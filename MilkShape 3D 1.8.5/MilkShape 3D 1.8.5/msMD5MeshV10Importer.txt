This plug-in for is provided as it is, 
and I take no responsibility for any damage it may cause!

This plug-in imports DOOM3 MD5 Mesh V10 files.
Currently there is no support for bones/joints.
There are some "joint-rotation" conversion problems between 
the doom3 md5mesh and the milkshape model format.
