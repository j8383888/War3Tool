msHideFaces.dll ver 1.0

What does it do?
Sylacs wanted a plugin that would hide all the front faces. This plugin allows you to do either front or back faces. You will get a dialog asking which viewport you are in and (Sorry, I can not tell.) the choice of hiding either front or back faces. Then they are hidden

Where is it?
The plugin will appear underneath the Face menu.

Limitations:
- None

What it can do:
- Looks through all the triangles and hides the ones that are either front or back faces according to which viewport was selected.

Requires:
Milkshape 3D 1.6.5

TODO:
- nothing

History:
1.0 - Original Release

Note:
A big thanks to ioquan who told me how to do the checking the proper way.
