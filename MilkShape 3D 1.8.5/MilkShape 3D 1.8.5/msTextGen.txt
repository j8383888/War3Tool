==================
    msTextGen
   Version 1.0
==================


DESCRIPTION
==================
This is a 3d text generator for Milkshape3d.


REQUIREMENTS
==================
 - Milkshape3d registered or unregistered versions v1.x.x


INSTALLATION
==================
 - Unzip the contents of this file into the directory in which
   you have installed Milkshape3d. This will usually be
   something like: "C:\Program Files\MilkShape 3D 1.6.2"
   replacing '1.6.2' with the version of ms3d you are using.
 - Now start Milkshape3d, and you should see a new entry in
   the tools menu called 'Text Generator'.


LIMITATIONS
==================
Milkshape3d is a low poly modeller. As such, only a relatively
low (compared to other apps) number of polygons can be created.
This limits the length of the text you can create, depending on
which font you use.
