Height Map Generator plugin for Milkshape 3D
Version: 1.1.7

---------------------
Version History::
---------------------

1.1.7 (19/10-2003):

  Changed:
    Updated the vertex/triangle limits to comply with Milkshape3D version 1.7.

1.1.6 (16/01-2003):

  Added:
    Help button now included in the dialog. Please note that for this to work, you should have
    extracted the .chm helpfile to the same folder as the plugin .dll file.

  Changed:
    Completely re-wrote the generator for random terrain, should now produces much nicer results, 
    but the process is also slower. Updated the helpfile.

1.1.5 (24/11-2002):

  Added:
    Helpfile in .chm format is now included in the plugin .zip.

  Changed:
    The preview window code has been re-written and should now work for all dimensions.
		A bug concerning saving that sneaked into the last version has been fixed.

1.1.4 (23/10-2002):

  Changed:
    Changed some internal code to speed things up.
    Enabled zero-sum kernel for the custom effect.

1.1.3 (20/10-2002):

  Fixed:
    This time it should even work :) I missed some memleaks in the last release, thanks to Mete for helping me ( once again      :D ).

1.1.2:

  Fixed:
    Memory allocation problem in the loading code (thanx mijacs!)
    

1.1.1:

  Added:
    Saving BMPs should now be working correctly.

  Changed:
    Loading files larger than 256x256 no longer results in a crash, the images are instead cut down to 256x256. I plan on
    making it scale the image, but I haven't had much time for this lately, so it'll be in a future version (if people really
    want it).

  Changed:
    The max dimensions for the plugin has been raised to 256x256, but the 89x89 restrictions still apply for use in
    Milkshape.

1.1.0:

  Info:
    I've started on the save function, but I decided to release 1.1 without save enabled, because there are still some things
    that need to be looked over. Hope you manage anyway. =)

  Added:
    Custom effect. Click the '...' button to the right and a dialog will pop up to allow you to edit a 3x3 kernel. This
    kernel will be used when you click the Custom effect button (if it is valid). Image processing with kernels is pretty
    cool, do a search if you want some more theory. Have fun, just remember that the sum of all the kernel fields must be
    larger than 0!
    
  Changed:
    Image loading code now done with FreeImage, so lots of formats are now supported. Thanks Mete!

  Changed:
    Updated almost all parts of the code for greater stability.

1.0.0:

  Info:
    One important note is that this plugin supports Height Maps up to 89x89 quads in size, this is the max resolution allowed
    by Milkshape, so there's not much to do about it in this version. I've added and changed a lot since the last release,
    most of it isn't really visible to the user, except for the Load Height Map function. The files supported are 24-bit BMPs
    with legal dimensions, 16-bit or paletted BMPs are not supported yet. I've also added checks to make certain MS doesn't
    crash when you try to generate to large a terrain.
