Rogue Spear QOB importer for Milkshape3D by Peter Sienkiewicz  email: pms2@njit.edu

This plugin imports a QOB model into Milkshape3D. The textures (RSB) need to be manually
converted in BMP as MS3D doesnt currently support the format.

Note:
1. Some files make take 10-15 to load, this is because the whole file needs to 
be parsed, then loaded in.
2. The Ghost Recon QOB format is not yet supported. I should release a plugin in the future.
3. An exporter should be out soon for Rogue Spear QOB.


Special Thanks:

DragonZap (for his help in understanding the basics of the plugins)
Mike Schell (help with the understanding of UV coordinates in the QOB files)
Mete (for writing MS3D :P)
