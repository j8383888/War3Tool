Snap plugin for Milkshape 3D
Version: 1.0.4

---------------------
Version History::
---------------------

1.0.4 (25/01-2003):

  Added:
    The plugin can now snap joints. Please note that this option is disabled by default to avoid screwing with people's animations.

  Changed:
    Changed the plugin to the 'Tool' type, so it should work fine even if you use Milkshape < 1.6.5.

1.0.3 (13/12-2002):

  Added:
    I thought it was annoying getting the dialog every time, so I've now done a quick fix that allows you to hold down the Ctrl key while activating the plugin to run the snap directly without seeing the dialog ( only other way I thought of doing it was to make 2 plugins, which isn't very userfriendly ).

1.0.2 (12/12-2002):

  Added:
    Added checkbuttons for X/Y/Z, if you uncheck one of these, the plugin won't snap on that axis.

1.0.1 (12/12-2002):

  Changed:
    Fixed a really stupid bug causing the snap to act weird. ( Fixing this actually took longer than writing the plugin in the first place :| )

1.0.0 (12/12-2002):

  Info:
    First release.
