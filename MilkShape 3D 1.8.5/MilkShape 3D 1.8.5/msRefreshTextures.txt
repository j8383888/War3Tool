Texture Refresh Plugin (msRefreshTextures.dll) for MilkShape 3D
By Heliophobe (mrscreen@hotmail.com)
===============================================================

Description:
------------
Adds a menu item to your Edit menu called 'Refresh Textures.'
This plugin will cause MilkShape 3D to reload all your diffuse and alpha texture images. 
The reloaded textures will be instantly visible in your textured viewports.

Just the thing if you want to fine tune your textures in a paint program, and quickly see the results on your model.
Previously, you had to either reload the model in MilkShape, or reselect the texture file in the materials editor.

Installation:
-------------
Before installation, you might want to check if your version of MilkShape already has a function to reload textures.
As of version 1.6.5, this feature did not exist, but the author may choose to add it to future versions. If so, 
you don't need to install this plugin.

As with all MilkShape Plugins, just copy the plugin file (msRefreshTextures.dll) to your current MilkShape directory.
In most cases, that will be 'c:\Program Files\MilkShape 1.x.x', where 1.x.x is the current version. Refresh Textures will
be available next to you start Milkshape.


Usage:
------

Just select 'Refresh Textures' from the Edit menu after saving your changes to your model in your paint program. If you
don't see the result of your changes with in a second or two, check to see that the texture you're editting in your paint 
program is the same one that you have selected for your texture, and make sure you remembered to save.

Note that MilkShape will consider the model to have been modified if you refresh your textures, so when you close your model,
it will ask if you want to save your changes, even if you haven't made any. This is because of the way the plugin tricks
MilkShape into reloading your textures. It's the same as reselecting each file from the Materials tool, except the plugin does 
it for you. 

History:
