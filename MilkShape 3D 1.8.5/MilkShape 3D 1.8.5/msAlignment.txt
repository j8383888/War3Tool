Positioning tools plusing for milkshape 3D
msAlignment.dll
-------------------------------------------------

Positioning tools is a set of tools that allow for the easy alignment and distribution of selected Vertices, Faces and Meshes.

The Alignment tool lets you align objects relative to either the Origin point (0,0,0), to a specified point or to the selected items themselves.

The Distribution tool lets you distribute the selected objects relative to themselves. You can easily remove the space between objects, even the space between and even specify the spacing. Both of these tools allow for more control over position of objects within Milkshape.

As I'm not an avid C win32 programmer I ask your understanding for any common mistakes you may find and would be glad for any advice or changes you may make. If you make any changes to this plugin itself (e.g. not a completely new plugin) please let me know so I may update it myself and give you the appropriate credit.
