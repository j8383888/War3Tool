Known Issues for Ver 0.93 beta (TODO list)


1. Only bmp, dds, dib, jpg, png, and tga texture
   formats are currently supported.  (This will be
   fixed in a future release)

2. Vertex selection mode is not finished.

3. Flat shading uses vertex normals instead of
   face normals.

4. As with all plugins, you will need to re-weld
   your vertices after using Selection Editor.

5. Please report bugs to the SDK forum where you
   downloaded this plugin from.

   will make it in, but I'd like to make this 
   plugin as useful as possible.
