Explosion plugin for MilkShape 3D.
msToolExplode.dll 
Tested with: MilkShape 3D 1.6.5
-------------------------------------------------

This plugin splits a model into individual triangles, adds a bone to each triangle and adds a keyframe 
to each bone. It basically sends the triangles spinning away from the center of explosion.

How to use:
Copy msToolExplode.dll to your MilkShape home directory and restart MilkShape. Under the "Tools" menu, 
select "Explode".

Limitations:
- There are max 128 bones allowed in a scene, so max 128 triangles can be animated. I tried to assign 
several triangles to each bone, but that didn't look very good. Still looking for a workaround.
- All triangles in the exploded mesh are flat. Haven't figured out a way to retain normals from a 
smoothed mesh when the vertices are unwelded.

This software is freeware. I'm not exactly sure what subtle legal meanings that has, but the point 
is: Do whatever you like with it, but don't claim you wrote it. If you redistribute it, please make 
sure all files are included. Use at on your own risk; if it eats your computer, don't blame me;).
