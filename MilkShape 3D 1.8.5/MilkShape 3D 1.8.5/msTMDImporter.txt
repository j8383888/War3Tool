Milkshape TMD Importer Plug-In v1.1 (c) 2001 DragonZap, dragonzap1@aol.com

This plug-in for Milkshape is provided as-is, and I assume no
responsibility whatsoever for any damage it may cause. It shouldn't,
of course, but I have to cover all my bases (ARE BELONG TO US!).

HOW TO USE:
    1. Put the included "msTMDImporter.dll" file in your Milkshape program
       directory.
    2. Run Milkshape. You'll find it listed under the "Import" menu.

The plug-in imports Playstation .TMD model files. I've heard they're
often found on Playstation Underground demo discs, and sometimes hidden
deep inside data files.

Only meshes are imported. Shading and pigmentation of polygons are not
supported at all.

As .TMD files can hold multiple models, they will be imported as
multiple groups.

Version history:
1.1	- Added support for double-sided polygons and setting up UV maps
1.0	- Initial release
