Warcraft III MDX Importer v1.1 for MilkShape 3D by UniKorn - contact@absenceoflight.net
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This plugin imports MDX models from the game Warcraft III Reign of Chaos & Frozen Throne,
and convert related BLP Textures to BMP with alpha channel.

Only meshes and materials are supported for now.
Bones, sequences, materials alphamaps and transparency will be implemented in futur versions ... (maybe !)

What do you need ?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The only tool you need is a Warcraft III MPQ Pack Explorer/Extractor, such as WinMPQ (http://www.wc3campaigns.com),
in order to access the MDX and BLP files of the game.

How does it works ?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	1. Simply copy msWar3MDXImporter.dll into your MilkShape 3D root directory and run the program,
   	   Warcraft III MDX import will be available in the Import Menu.
	2. Browse to the MDX file you wish to import.
	3. Set the options : 
		"Meshes and/or Material import".
		"Reverse Axis" fit the model to MilkShape 3D axis order.
		"Copy Textures to MDX Folder" copy the exported BMP textures in the same directory as the MDX model.
		If not selected, the BLP Textures are converted in their original folder.
	4. Validate and enjoy the result.

In order to import and convert the BLP textures correctly, you have to respect the original MPQ file tree structure,
that can be done by extracting the WHOLE package.

Please report bugs, questions, suggestions, love for french people like me and others at contact@absenceoflight.net
