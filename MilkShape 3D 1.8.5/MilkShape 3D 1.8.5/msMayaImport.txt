msMayaImport.txt

Why?
- Cowsmanaut wanted it.

What does it do?
- The plugin tries to import Maya Ascii (.ma) files. They need to be triangulated first.

Installing:
- Put it in your MilkShape folder.

Limitations:
- Possibly figured out front/back sides.
- Possibly figured out uv
- Does not do skeletons or animations yet.

Thanks:
