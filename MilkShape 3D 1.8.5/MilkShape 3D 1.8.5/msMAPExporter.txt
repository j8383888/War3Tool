Milkshape Q3Radiant MAP Export Plug-In (c) 2003 by Jochen Winzen, winzen@online.de

This plug-in is provided as it is, and I take no responsibility for any damage it may cause!

With this plug-in you can easily create .map files for Q3Radiant based editors (GtKRadiant, EFRadiant, ...).
You load a 3D model into Milkshape and export it to Q3Radiant MAP. Every face of the model will become 
a 5-sided brush this means all faces are extruded by "Wall thickness" units. Default is -8 so all walls will 
go inside the model (to preserve surface structure). 1 unit in a Q3 map is ca. 2cm of real world size so 
you should resize your models (if you used meters scale modelsize 50 times larger).

Materials will preserve their textures in the following way:
If a material has a texture "floor01.jpg" and you export your model to "mytest.map" the created brushes 
with this material will reference to "mytest/floor01".
So you have to copy all used textures (in tga or jpg format only) into a new subfolder "mytest" of your 
texture path in the MAP editor. Then your map will almost look like your original 3D model!
This plug-in can't substitute the mapping process but it creates a nice starting point for your own maps.

I hope you like this plug-in.

P.S. I know that some important features (u,v-mapping, no brush overlaps, ...) are missing but maybe 
someone else has time to write a better plug-in ;-)
