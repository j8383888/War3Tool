This exporter is freeware.



Usage
-----

Close MilkShape 3D and copy the msNovodeX.dll into the directory of ms3d.exe.

The physics specific information is encoded into the group/joint name in form of tags.
Each group/joint name can have a maximum of 31 characters, so try to keep the names short.
Each group must have one material assigned.  That material can optionally have a texture,
which must be in the output directory. The tool will export a lot of ODS files, which can
be opened in a text editor like Notepad.

The resulting scene may be viewed with the viewer available at http://www.novodex.com.


Tags
----

To encode tags into a group/joint name, use the following syntax:

	<group/joint name>:<tag[=value]>,<tag[=value]>,...

i.e:

	Box01:m=10,f=0,r=1



Group Tags
----------

sp:	the group is a spherical object and will have a bounding sphere instead of a bounding
	box and spherical inertia.
tm:     the group will have mesh-mesh collision (TriangleMesh)
m:	mass
r:	restitutiom
f:	friction
s:	scale

Examples:	Sphere01:sp,m=10,r=0.8,f=0.6,s=1
		Box01:m=100,r=1



Joint Tags
----------

t:	type: sp = spherical, hi = hinge, pr = prismatic, sl = sliding
b:	bodies: <groupname>;<groupname>, <groupname> can also be WORLD.
d:	direction: any normalized direction vector in form of x;y;z
br:	breakable: 0 for unbreakable

Examples:	j1:t=sp,b=WORLD;Box01,br=90
		j2:t=hi,b=Box01;Box02,d=1;0;0
		j3:t=sl,b=Box02;Box03,d=0;0;1



Notes
-----

* A full featured exporter might be available in MilkShape 3D 2.0, without the
clumsy tags.

* To generate the samples, open the .ms3d file and run the menu command
Tools->NovodeX Object Description Script ODS...

* Don't create joint hierarchies. Make sure each joint has no parent.

* If you have long objects, let them have spherical inertia.

* To view a NovodeX demo, create a desktop shortcut for the "NovodeX Viewer" and
drag the demo.pds.ods onto that shortcut.
