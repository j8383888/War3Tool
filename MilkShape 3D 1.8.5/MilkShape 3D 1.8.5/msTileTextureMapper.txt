What is it?
-----------

This plugin generates texture coordinates to geometry for tile textures (also
known as seamless textures). Basically you choose the plane along which the
texture is repeated and number of repeats along u and v axis on that plane. 
Cubic mapping can be used for easily mapping textures on complex geometry.


How to use it?
--------------

The plug-in works on selected faces. Texture is repeated within minimal
rectangle that surrounds all selected vertices on plane (bounding rectangle).

To reverse texture direction on axis (mirror) set the repeat value on that
axis to a negative value.

Note! After mapping operation it is recommended to weld mapped vertices
together to reduce geometry vertex count.

Planar mapping:

The mapping plane is specified by choosing the coordinate source axes for
both u and v texture coordinate. Default settings use X axis as source for
horizontal (u) coordinates and Z axis for vertical (v) coordinates. This maps
the texture to XZ -plane (top view).

Use the 'Coplanar faces only' -option to apply texture coordinated only to
those selected faces that are parallel enough to the mapping plane (in less
than 45 degrees angle).

Cubic mapping:

Cubic mapping automatically maps texture on each selected face using planar
mapping with mapping plane that the face is parallel with. You only have to 
set the number of texture repeats in direction of each axis.

This is practically same thing as doing planar mapping six times with all 
possible axis configurations and with 'Coplanar faces only' -option set.
